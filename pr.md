1. What did you like about this website?

I really like the retro style of the website! It's super unique and creative, especially given the limited tools we had available for this project. I also really appreciate the navigation system.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's.

One big difference between this website and my website is that the content and formatting had a lot more variety between web pages. However, there was still a very cohesive style even with these different formats. This website also did a better job adjusting to screens of different sizes than my own website. Overall, these differences gave the website a much better user experience than my website.

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?

The code is well strucutred within the files. There is also good organization between files becuase there's separate files for css and images. One thing that improve the organization slightly is grouping the non-index html files into a single directory.

4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.

I didn't find any major issues with the code. The elements seemed to be appropriate for their purpose and the css was well organized and refactored to minimize duplication.

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

Fantastic job overall, it was a really useful and fun website to look at. One small thing to consider is that as the website window gets resized, parts of the navigation bar disappear. Some of these changes are purely aesthetic, but others have a more functional impact (such as the 'forgot password' link disappearing). As we go forward in the class, it's worth thinking about how those types of changes might impact the user's experience. Again, great job with the project!
